The "Personal Digital Assistants Listing App" is a beginner-friendly React application designed to provide a hands-on experience with key React concepts and best practices. This project showcases the creation and use of reusable components, the handling of props and destructuring, as well as the integration of CSS using the popular npm package, Bulma. At its core, the app allows users to explore a collection of personal digital assistants, complete with pictures and brief descriptions.</br>



## Key Features:</br>
- Reusable Components: The project demonstrates the power of React's component-based architecture. It offers a set of reusable UI components such as cards, and lists that maintain consistency and simplify development.</br>

- Styling with Bulma: The app employs the Bulma CSS framework, which can be easily incorporated into React projects using npm packages. This showcases how to leverage external libraries to style components and create an appealing user interface.</br>
- Digital Assistant Listings: The core functionality of the app is to display personal digital assistants in an organized and visually pleasing manner. Each listing includes a picture and a brief description of the assistant's capabilities.</br>
